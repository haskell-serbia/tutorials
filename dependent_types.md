# Dependent Types in Haskell
=================================
Haskell currently does not support dependent types natively but there are certain extensions that help us to get there.
It is not as elegant as it would be if we had build in support for this but Richard Eisenberg is busy at work doing a great
work to make this happen. 

We will go trough different steps in explaining dependent types in Haskell:

- Terms vs. Types
- Lambda Cube
- Local assumptions
- Generic 
- Sigma and Pi
